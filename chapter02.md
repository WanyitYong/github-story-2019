# Where has the Spring gone?
## Chapter 02: The Curse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myrtle had a feeling that her ignorance neighbour has suspected she the one who stolen the chicken. “Are you thinking that I’m the one who stole your chicken? When did I eat your chicken? Please let it be clearly now before you leave.”, refused by Myrtle with a fierce sound. 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I didn’t say that you stole that chicken, you say that yourself.”, replied Geraldine. “When did I say that I stole your chicken! Besides that, I got my own chicken also.”, replied Myrtle angrily. “Since you already eat the chicken, I don’t have any proof about the chicken is mine.”, said Geraldine.
 <br/><br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather still continues raining heavily, Myrtle is grabbing Geraldine collar, looking into her eyes. Suddenly, Myrtle slapped her faced, the sound was even louder than the rain. Geraldine start crying but still managed to fight back, until the rest of the people in this village arrived. Geraldine already lying on the ground, keep calling his husband and son name. 
 <br/><br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was framed up by her about the missing chicken.”, shouted Myrtle to the crowd, after that she said to the people “Since everyone is here, I put my word down. If I stole her chicken, I will suicide now in front of her.” Geraldine sit up and pointed to Myrtle “Well, if you have stolen my chicken, your son will died in this year. If not, my son then will die this year.” “Sure, let’s see whose son will dead this year then.”, replied Myrtle then went back to her own house. Geraldine now feels like she had won the fight and sleep over while crying. 
 <br/><br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning day, the chicken came back with a wet feather and a red ribbon on its leg. She quietly brings the chicken back to home and kill it. After that day, she feels guilty to Myrtle until she realised that even her neighbour didn’t steal the chicken but doesn’t mean there are no problem on her personality. She still remembers the blood taste in her mouth when she was slapped by Myrtle. Since then, they never talk to each other and tied a red ribbon on every chicken leg with the word “who stole the chicken, DIED!”
