&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed faster than imagine, the village has arrived the big day, St. Patrick’s Day. The villagers are excited for the returning of Myrtle’s son, William. William drove a luxury car with a lot of souvenir from the city for the villagers. Villagers spotted a nice-looking and attractive woman is sitting on the co-driver seat, right beside William, that’s his fiancée, they assumed. 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“Here we go. Come down please, Shauna. I’m going to introduce you to the folks.” says William.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shauna is my fiancée.” William introduced his fiancée to folks. 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geraldine was in the crowd and she feels jealous and unpleased that William got engaged yet her son hasn’t. Besides that, William, her neighbor son is running a huge business in the city but her son, Jack still only worked as a factory cleaner in city. Hence, Geraldine went down by the town on the next day to ring her son and wanted to demand him about getting engage before Easter, no matter the cost is. However, the phone never reached Jack and end up Jack turned his phone off. Geraldine got even angrier and then she had decided to lodge a police report at the Garda Police Station.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	“I’m here to lodge a report.” says Geraldine.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	“And you are ?” says receptionist.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	“Why do you care ? I’m here to lodge report.” Then, she whispered to the receptionist, “William is back.” 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“William who ?”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The William who flee away from gambling debt, he’s back.” 
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thanks for the information, Mistress.”, by police officers.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, a group of Gardai came to the village with fully prepared to arrest William. William tried to resist from getting arrested, but he was outnumbered.
Geraldine witnessed from the beginning and she gloat over about it and keep mumbling, “You deserve that, you deserve that.”
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the day, when Myrtle was on the way back to home from working, she heard the news. She feels hopeless and fainted when she gets home, then she was sent to hospital for medical care.
